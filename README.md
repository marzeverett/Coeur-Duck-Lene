# Coeur-Duck-Lene
A silly little dataset of rubber duckies in various beautiful locations in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Meant to help students train a small object detection dataset. For this reason, it also includes pictures of beautiful Coeur d'Alene without rubber duckies. Images were annotated using online CVAT software.
