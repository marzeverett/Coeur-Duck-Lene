# Coeur-Duck-Lene
A silly little dataset of rubber duckies in various beautiful locations in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Meant to help students train a small object detection dataset. For this reason, it also includes pictures of beautiful Coeur d'Alene locations without rubber duckies. Images were annotated using online [CVAT](https://app.cvat.ai/) software.

## Format
These images were annotated specifically for use in training a Yolov8 ultralytics model. The image size is quite small, 403 x 302 pixels. Since this training is meant to take place in Google Colab, the data.yaml file lists the working directory as the user's Google drive location. 

## Possible Future Work 
* Perhaps ... MORE duck pictures in scenic Coeur d'Alene locations!
* The Colab notebook file for training a very basic model.
